Hello! Welcome to my homepage!

I'm Fernando Yang, and I'm currently studying Computer Science at IME-USP in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.

You may be confused about the origin of Hagisf, it was actually just a random name I wrote down when I needed a nickname for games like diep.io, but I liked it and so it became a real nickname for most of my social media.

I'm using this github-based blog to publish progress on my studies, so I'll share here some of the things I'm doing now or have already completed.

Hope you enjoy it!
